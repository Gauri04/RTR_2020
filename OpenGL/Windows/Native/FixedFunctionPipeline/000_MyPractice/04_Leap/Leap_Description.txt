Leap
Description :
This demo tries to show story of a little bird who is afraid to fly after meeting with an accident.
The bird then gets motivated after seeing another bird flying freely in the sky, and takes a step ahead to fly.
The demo tries to showcase that we all face some fallbacks in our journey, but all it takes is determination and dare which enables us to leap far and high, just like the bird.
